# EASY-ML 2025 | Hands-On Practice Repository

Welcome to my collection of hands-on exercises, projects, and notebooks from the **East-African School for Young Researchers on Advanced Machine Learning Techniques (EASY-ML)** held from **July 9‚Äì22, 2025**.

This repository reflects my personal learning journey through a two-week immersive workshop, where we explored both foundational and cutting-edge machine learning concepts with a strong emphasis on **practical applications** using **Python** and **PyTorch**.
